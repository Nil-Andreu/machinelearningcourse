This repository will be for the practice of the exercises that are done in the course of Machine Learning I am currently taking on Udemy. The link of the course is the following: https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearningpython/
Highly recommended taking it for an introduction to the Data Science.

The exercises will be done and explained as easy as possible so everybody that enters to this respository can understand what is going on in every line of code (and ultimately understanding also about Machine Learning).
